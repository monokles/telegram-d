# telegram-d
Bot API wrapper and library for Telegram in D

This is me playing around with D templates

*heavy wip* 

Currently most of the telegram bot API is implemented, except for inline keyboards.

#TODO
1. add websockets support
2. add file up/download support
3. add inline keyboard support
4. write Bot class for convenience of use
